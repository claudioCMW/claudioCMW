&#129300; Who am I?  </h2>

<h3> From an early age, my fascination with technology was evident through my innate curiosity. I would dismantle remote controls, radios, and any electronic device to understand how they worked. My persistent interest in learning led me to explore the fundamental question: How does it operate, and what drives it?

My curiosity about computer sales sparked a desire to acquire one of my own. After diligently saving, I obtained my first computer and, driven by my inquisitive nature, I spent hours, even early mornings, unraveling its secrets. Although my exploration occasionally resulted in frequent visits to the repair shop, this experience convinced me of the need to formally study computer science.

My education included earning a degree in hardware and software repair at an institute. However, I felt that knowing these aspects did not fully satisfy my goals. Following my brother's advice, I enrolled at the University of LujÃ¡n, where I immersed myself in the Bachelor's program in Information Systems, a discipline closely aligned with my interests. The early stages of the course involved diving into binary codes, algebra, systems, and structured programming.

The revelation came with my first programming course. Surprisingly, I found a deep connection with the discipline and dedicated significant time to understanding it. I successfully completed courses such as Introduction to Programming, Programming 1 and 2, OOP, Functional and Logic Programming, and Computer Organization Assembler, among others.

Inspired by a classmate who joined HENRY and quickly entered the workforce, I decided to follow in his footsteps. The process culminated in my incorporation as a Full Stack Developer at a software company. My focus is not to compete with others but to constantly surpass myself. I seek not only to find answers but also to pose new questions and expand my knowledge.

My commitment, responsibility, and teamwork skills have been demonstrated throughout my career. I fully understand the values of goal-setting, responsibility, leadership, camaraderie, and dedication. My aim is to contribute to the success of the team and the organization, standing out as a dedicated and reliable professional.</h3>
